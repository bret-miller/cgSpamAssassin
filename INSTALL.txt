SpamAssassin, including spamc and spamd should be installed prior to using this
interface. Requires Perl and Time::HiRes. Tested with ActivePerl 5.20.

Tested with SpamAssassin for Windows by JAM Software.

Installing the basic interface:
1. Copy cgSpamAssassin.pl and cgSpamAssassin.conf to your CommuniGate Pro base
   directory.
2. Edit cgSpamAssassin.conf with your environment-specific settings.
3. Create a helper definition. I called mine SpamAssassin. Set the program path
   to the path to cgSpamAssassin.pl. On Windows, you must call perl with the 
   script as the parameter: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe cgSpamAssassin.pl
   I suggest you use "all info" for the log level at first. You can elminate
   logging later if you choose.
4. Create a mail rule to EXTFILTER SpamAssassin your messages.
5. Create a mail rule to store and drop messages tagged as spam.

Using the CheckClamd tool for Windows:
1. Copy the entire CheckClamd directory under your SpamAssassin program 
   directory. If you don't use the default IP (127.0.0.1) and port, edit
   the CheckClamd.cmd and adjust it to use your custom IP and port.
2. Create a scheduled task to run CheckClamd with the SpamAssassin program
   directory as the working directory. I run mine every 5 minutes. It pings
   the clamd service to make sure the IP and port are responding. If not, it
   kills the clamd process and restarts it.
